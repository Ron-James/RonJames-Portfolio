            Assessing the Value in Design and Aesthetics in Web Development
          </h1>
          <p>
            This blog post intends to discuss what I believe to be the most
            important aspects involved in the design and aesthetics of web
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historically, the age-old debate of functionality vs aesthetics has
            rumbled on but it definitely feels as if contemporary designers have
            begun to accept that the two sides go hand in hand when creating a
            web experience. I’ve always felt the argument has always been
            one-sided as usability engineers and technocrats have wanted to
            argue that what they specialise in is the bit that is actually
            important and that the aesthetics and design elements which, let’s
            be honest, aren’t usually within the technical engineer’s wheelhouse
            (I can say this as a qualified software engineer myself), are
            thought to be the extra unnecessary fluff. It’s always seemed to be
            that there’s nothing that quite undermines good user interface
            design than it lacking a good aesthetic design. As the years go by,
            there really is no excuse for your design to be lacking on your
            website.

            That being said, I would argue that the first aspect to be
            considered when designing a webpage should be the user experience
            and functionality as this will dictate how people will perceive both
            a website’s creator and the service being put forward by said
            website. If Airbnb didn’t have such a sleek and well-oiled user
            experience and interface design, it would definitely undermine the
            service they are trying to sell. Functionality can be defined as how
            easy it is to get what you came for from a web page. For instance,
            how easy is it to find an article to read when visiting the New York
            Times website? In this instance, it’ll likely be the first thing you
            come across upon visiting and you can be reading that article within
            seconds of finding it. In the modern age, I would say it’s getting
            more and more difficult to get away with having a slow and clunky
            user interface that is constantly having to load new pages. Users
            have become too accustomed to smooth, sleek and fast web experiences
            with the likes of Netflix or Youtube to give anything much less the
            time of day becomes a hard ask of contemporary users.
          </p>

            The next thing to consider in my view is the use of graphics on your
            webpage. The web is predominantly a visual medium so it’s important
            that everything you are trying to represent is accompanied by a
            carefully selected graphic to give the user an idea of what you’re
            going for. A good example of this is the use of thumbnails on
            Netflix. Not only are the thumbnails designed to catch your eye with
            how they represent a TV show or movie, but they also lead the user
            into a preview of said media. The use of graphics should be
            eye-catching where necessary or subtle when used to enhance other
            aspects of your web page’s aesthetics. Things like background
            shouldn’t overpower the elements in the foreground to avoid
            distracting the user from what is important in a given context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final thing which I wish to discuss in this post regarding
            aesthetic web page design is that of interactivity. The world wide
            web is also an interactive medium that grants the potential for user
            interaction and subsequently, feedback. Users want to feel as if
            their input when using a web page is being acknowledged by the
            interface as it creates a sense of agency within the experience. If
            you hover your mouse over an element, you want some kind of response
            to indicate that if you click on the element, something will happen.
            The most common implementation of this is when you hover over a
            button or a link, it animates or at the very least is highlighted in
            some way. A good example of quality interactivity is how when you
            hover over a thumbnail on YouTube, it plays a short and soundless
            preview of part of the video in question, giving the user an idea of
            what to expect if they do choose to click on the video.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, the design and aesthetics of a website cannot really
            be ignored in the modern day without it potentially resulting in
            your website being ignored. Functionality should be propped up with
            the use of carefully selected graphics and good implementation of
            interactive elements.
